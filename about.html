Hello! I am Joyce Okanda, an ambitious IT professional living the way of technology and innovation. 
I have hands-on experience in programming, cybersecurity, mobile app development, artificial intelligence,
 and web development using HTML,
CSS, C++, and JavaScript. My interest in computers led to formal studies at Balozi Training Institute.
Despite the financial challenges in 2023, W4. EmpServe Kenya made further studies easy by awarding me a
scholarship to continue learning and refining my skills.
I'm particularly proud of the development of a mobile app aimed at reducing cases of Gender-Based Violence
in communities. All this stems from my commitment to user-centered solutions and security. I am also
enthusiastic about nurturing diversity in tech by mentoring young women and engaging in tech forums in 
order to stay current with the latest trends.
Thanks for stopping by my portfolioâ€”let's connect and explore the world of IT together!
